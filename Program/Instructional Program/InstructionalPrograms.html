                            application, integration and development in computational and problem solving skills needed in real life situations. Positive attitude 
                            to the subject is cultivated through related activities and games to make Math more pleasurable. Students’ creativity in problem solving 
                            is likewise developed. The learning content is so sequenced that lessons are gradually geared towards abstract reasoning, logical and 
                            analytical thinking to help students make fair decisions and choose from several alternatives. Likewise, values of accuracy, precision,
